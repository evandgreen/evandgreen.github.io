                this is my web page. 
                this is my containment zone. 
                this is a digital oasis. 
                this is where it's at. 
                this is the future of web design. 
                this is user-hostility.
                this is awesometown, USA; mayor speaking. 
                are you even reading this? 
                this is a phone free zone. 
                this is the first day of my life.

                this is post hyperreality.

        <div class="quotes" style="font: 14px/14px times-new-roman, serif">
            <ol style="font-variant: small-caps;">
                <li>Don’t smoke cigarettes.</li>
                <li>Drive old Japanese cars. Easy and cheap to fix & they run for fucking ever.</li>
                <li>Buy most of your groceries from the produce section. Most of that other shit is not actually food. You don’t need it.</li>
                <li>Ride your bike instead of driving as much as you can. You need the exercise and gas is expensive.</li>
                <li>Don’t have kids. They’re not miracles, they’re people. 7 billion is too fucking many. Find some other way to give your dull existence some meaning. BTW they’re expensive.</li>
                <li>Get your clothes from thrift stores. With the physique you’ll have from riding your bike, you’ll look hot wearing anything.</li>
                <li>Learn to fix things. Tons of great books and youtube vids on fixing anything. or ask an old dude. People used to fix things. no shit.</li>
                <li>Learn a trade – carpentry, plumbing, electrical, auto mechanics, tailoring, computer/electronics repair, something they can’t fucking outsource. No one gives a shit about your masters in dostoyevsky or your high score on world of warcraft…. Fix something, dumbass, fix something!</li>
                <li>If you like booze, drink at home with your neighbors. Drunk driving is for assholes, rich ones with lawyers.</li>
                <li>Do people favors. It’s called cooperation. It’s how the world worked before money. They will return the favor, or someone will. No shit. This really works.</li>
                <li>Make things – look around you. what do you see? yah, shitty stuff made by impoverished enslaved people far away. Pick anything. Make a better one. People want good shit. You won’t get rich, but you’ll get by.</li>
                <li>If you live in america – don’t get sick and avoid injury. Wear your fucking helmet and put lights on your bike.</li>
                <li>Find work you love. If you can’t do that, then find a job where you love the people.</li>
                <li>Junkies and addicts are like toddlers. They just want to shit all over you and everything. The messes they make can get expensive. Avoid them if you can.</li>
                <li>Don’t buy shit on credit, remember what happened to america? Cash only, fuckers. Can’t afford it? Don’t fucking buy it!</li>
                <li>Preventable expenses – std’s, abortions, dwi’s, lung cancer, head injuries, speeding tickets, cirrhosis of the liver.</li>
                <li>Don’t go on fancy dates if you’re not fancy. Most people kind of despise the rich anyway.</li>
                <li>When you go see shows, bring a flask in. That way you can afford to buy a record.</li>
                <li>If you had told me 15 years ago that Coca Cola would put tap water in plastic bottles and motherfuckers would buy it …… no fuckin way.</li>
                <li>Don’t get cable. Asshole. There is nothing on. I promise. $100 a month ? Fuck no!</li>
